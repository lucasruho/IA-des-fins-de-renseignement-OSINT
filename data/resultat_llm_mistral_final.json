The agreement between the US and South Korea on joint nuclear planning is destabilizing and will have serious consequences for regional security and global stability, according to a statement by Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova published on Friday. \"We saw the reports about the agreement between the US and the Republic of Korea on joint planning with respect to the use of nuclear weapons. This turn of events is clearly destabilizing in nature and will have serious negative consequences for regional security projecting onto global stability,\" the diplomat said. According to the spokeswoman, the US and its allies in the APAC region have demonstratively indicated a move in the region toward replicating \"the patterns, destructive for international security, of the so-called ‘extended nuclear deterrence,’ which Washington has been using for decades following the end of the Cold War and continues to develop within NATO with the full support of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a self-proclaimed ‘nuclear alliance.’\" \"We are confident that the further spread of such practices by the collective West will do nothing but escalate tensions, whip up crises in the security sphere and provoke an arms race,\" she added. \"We are urging the US and its allies who, in pursuit of definitive military superiority, are implementing a number of military programs that undermine global strategic stability, to stop exacerbating the situation and quit taking steps that weaken the overall level of security for all countries,\" Zakharova noted. On Wednesday, following a summit in Washington, the presidents of the Republic of Korea and the United States, Yoon Suk-yeol and Joe Biden, approved a declaration under which South Korea affirmed its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, while the US pledged to provide information on strategic and nuclear planning. Biden also reiterated that any nuclear attack on South Korea by the DPRK would result in a swift and overwhelming response. Additionally, the US vowed to step up the deployment of its strategic arms on the Korean Peninsula, including nuclear submarines.",

        "text": "MINSK, April 28. /TASS/. The US takes advantage of areas of instability by unleashing proxy wars against the countries where Washington wants to gain control of resources, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s defense ministers on Friday. \"To avoid a direct military clash, gray zones of instability around the selected victim state are used and proxy wars are waged,\" he was quoted as saying by the press service of the Belarusian Defense Ministry. The minister stated that \"the unipolar world that has existed for the last 30 years is becoming a thing of the past.\" \"At the same time, certain forces are faced with the crisis of globalization, built on the monetary, financial, technological and cultural dominance of the United States. It is extremely important for them to maintain a unipolar model of the world,\" he said. Khrenin said the goal of such a system is to control resources on a planetary scale. According to Khrenin, Washington's activity destabilizes the regions, forcing other countries to enter into confrontation. \"The American policy aimed at extracting unilateral benefits from any crisis in the world has clearly manifested itself. The national and coalition doctrinal documents of countries lay claim to global and regional dominance. The bloc security architecture is being cemented,\" the Belarusian minister said. He pointed out that the current moment in history can also serve to develop new models of supranational relations, in which countries must \"coordinate foreign policy and increase defense capabilities, regardless of external factors.\" Khrenin said that Minsk has consistently advocated strengthening international security on the basis of a collective approach that does not tolerate confrontational thinking or any exclusivity. \"That is why we have set ourselves the goal of becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have completed all the necessary internal procedures for accession and are ready to participate in full in the organization's activities in all areas of cooperation,\" he said. Belarus, which had been a dialogue partner in the SCO since 2010, gained observer status in the group in 2015. In 2022, the organization started procedures to make the country a member. The SCO includes Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Currently, Iran is also in the process of joining the SCO. Afghanistan and Mongolia have observer status in the organization, while Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Egypt, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and Turkey are dialogue partners.",

        "text": "MELITOPOL, April 28. /TASS/. A potential Ukrainian landing at Energodar, signs of which are visible on the right bank of the Dnieper River, could be meant to divert attention away from a larger attempted Ukrainian counterattack in the Zaporozhye Region, Vladimir Rogov, chairman of the We Are Together with Russia movement, told TASS on Friday. \"In the area of Nikopol, we are seeing a particularly large number of watercraft, which may be directed toward Energodar, Kamenka-Dneprovskaya and other suburbs. I believe it may be a diversionary strike. <...> A rather large number of fighters are accumulated there, so it is quite possible that they will make the diversionary strike as serious as possible, so that we’ll believe it [is real], and simultaneously they’ll make a parallel strike on a another section [of the line of engagement],\" Rogov said. According to him, on the right bank of the Dnieper, across from Energodar, there are now Ukrainian units with experience in urban warfare. \"Quite a long stretch of the river bank west and east of Nikopol, where fighters are accumulating. <...> Among the units that have been identified, there is the Ukrainian 71st jaeger brigade. It took part in the fighting in Artyomovsk. It’s not quite clear why they were moved to Nikopol, given their extensive experience in combat operations in urban areas,\" Rogov noted. Rogov told TASS on Thursday that the Ukrainian army command plans to complete the redeployment of the 46th airborne assault brigade, as well as the 116th and 118th brigades to the Zaporozhye area on April 30, in addition to the 12,000 fighters already on the line of engagement near Gulyaipole. According to his assessment, should an offensive be launched in this area, Ukrainian units would avoid fighting in the cities and instead attempt break through to the Sea of Azov east of Melitopol to cut the land corridor to Crimea.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI, April 28. /TASS/. The conflict in Ukraine has made it clear that Washington and its allies are aiming to provoke other countries into sparking a military standoff with Moscow and Beijing, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Friday. \"Today, Washington and its collaborators are implementing their strategic plan to provoke other countries into a military standoff with Russia and China. The conflict in Ukraine serves as a striking confirmation of this criminal policy. Its actual goal is to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, create a threat for China and preserve [the US’] monopoly position in the world,\" Shoigu pointed out at a meeting of the defense ministers of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member states in New Delhi. According to him, \"this is why over $5 billion was spent on the anti-constitutional ‘Maidan’ coup [in Ukraine] in 2014, which led to the emergence of a hostile nationalist, Russophobic regime that set out with particular zeal to resolve the ‘Russian question’ in Ukraine.\" \"Given Kiev’s refusal to implement the Minsk Agreements and the real threat facing residents of the Donbass, we decided to launch a special military operation,\" Shoigu noted. On Friday, the Indian capital is hosting an SCO defense ministers meeting that brings together the defense chiefs of India, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, as well as the SCO secretary general, the director of the Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, and the defense ministers of Belarus and Iran, which hold the status of SCO observers.",

Russia is taking steps to boost the combat readiness of forces stationed at its military bases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan amid attempts by the US to restore its military footprint in Central Asia, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Friday. He noted the efforts of the US and its allies to restore their military presence in the region under the guise of assisting in the fight against terrorism. \"We view [Washington’s] requests to deploy military infrastructure to countries in the region as a direct threat to stability in the SCO space,\" Shoigu said at a meeting of SCO defense ministers in New Delhi. \"For our part, we are beefing up the combat readiness of [forces stationed at] Russian military bases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan as well as of other response forces in the event of potential threats,\" he said. That said, the Russian defense minister noted that, \"NATO countries, following their 20-year presence on Afghan soil and their hasty departure [from the country], bear the greatest responsibility for the situation unfolding there.\" \"They should bear the burden of the main financial expenditures for post-conflict recovery efforts,\" Shoigu said.",

Windows of the turbine hall of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZNPP), shattered during a Ukrainian drone attack on April 12, have been repaired, said Renat Karchaa, an advisor to the chief executive of Russia’s Rosenergoatom nuclear power plant operator. \"Windows in the turbine hall have been fixed with glass panels and chipboard sheets,\" he said. The Zaporozhye NPP is the largest in Europe and has a capacity of about 6,000 MW. It used to generate a quarter of all electrical power in Ukraine. The ZNPP consists of six power units and since 1996 had operated as a detached unit of the Energoatom national nuclear power generating company, controlled by Kiev. In March 2022, the ZNPP came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Since then, units of the Ukrainian army have periodically shelled both the residential areas of Energodar and the premises of the plant itself, using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Earlier, Karchaa said windows in the turbine building of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZNPP) were smashed on April 12, as a result of continuous attacks of Ukrainian attack drones. Vladimir Rogov, who heads the We Are Together With Russia movement, said later that Russian troops protecting the station had shot down more than 70 drones on April 22.",

We see everything and try to eliminate members of Ukrainian armed groups at the first opportunity,\" he told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday night. Earlier in the day, Pushilin said Russian forces were controlling 50 out of Maryinka’s 59 residential quarters, and practically all Ukrainian positions were in sight. In his words, Russian forces are advancing steadily, despite Ukrainian forces’ attempts to offer resistance. Maryinka is a town with a population of around 10,000 west of Donetsk. Remaining Ukrainian forces in the area have entrenched themselves in the residential sector on the town’s western outskirts, while all multi-storey buildings are already under Russian control. On April 11, Pushilin said that Russian troops had considerably improved their positions in the town, taking under control Ukraine’s major strategic stronghold in the area on the territory of a local tire repair plant. DPR officials said earlier that liberation of Maryinka would put Alexandrovka, the Petrovsky and Tekstilshchik districts of Donetsk out of reach for Ukrainian shelling attacks.",

The exercise was part of a fast-tracked project to create a modern air defense system in Poland, the radio station said. However, it is not yet known exactly where the debris came from: the missile itself or the object that was used as a target, the RMF reports. Fragments of an air-to-surface missile were spotted in the woods a dozen kilometers from the town of Bydgoszcz, the radio station reported on Wednesday morning. Earlier, Prosecutor-General and Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the wreckage of a military air object on the territory of the country had been found. He did not elaborate.",

The odds that a safety zone around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) will be created by the end of the year are low, Renat Karchaa, an advisor to the chief executive of Russia’s Rosenergoatom nuclear power plant operator, told TASS. Earlier, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi expressed hope during a visit to Turkey’s Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant that a safety zone at the Zaporozhye facility would be set up by the end of the year. \"I personally believe that the likelihood of an agreement on the safety zone and mechanisms around the ZNPP being made [before the end of the year] is not high. My forecast is that Ukraine will once again bring talks to a deadlock. Ukraine is not interested in establishing effective mechanisms that would guarantee nuclear security,\" Karchaa pointed out. According to him, reaching an agreement depends on numerous factors, including the parties’ \"levelheadedness, professional approaches and willingness to make nuclear security a priority.\" However, Karchaa highlighted the need to continue dialogue on the issue in order to \"consistently defend our position\" regardless of the difficulties. \"Nothing, none of our activities and agreements should harm Russia’s interests, the ZNPP’s nuclear security or people,\" he added. Grossi made his second visit to the Zaporozhye NPP on March 29. In particular, he was able to see the facilities that were damaged in shelling attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces. Grossi told reporters later that the IAEA was now focused on protecting the actual nuclear plant rather than the area around it. He also stated that the station’s demilitarization was no longer under consideration.",

And one of the main instruments of achieving this goal is the development of scientific and industrial cooperation on manufacturing military products, their modernization and maintenance,\" he said, opening the commission’s meeting. \"Work in this direction has been underway for many years but partnership opportunities have not been fully implemented by far,\" Manturov said. According to him, the commission will discuss a set of proposals for the further integration of defense enterprises taking national interests into account. He also thinks that it is necessary to focus on the standardization of arms and military equipment within the framework of the CSTO. The CSTO Interstate Commission on Military-Economic Cooperation was established by the CSTO Collective Security Council on June 23, 2005. One of the main functions of the commission is producing recommendations and solutions to provide comprehensive military-economic and military-technical cooperation in priority interaction areas within the CSTO.",

        "text": "MELITOPOL, April 27. /TASS/. A scheduled rotation of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is set to take place later today, Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Russia’s Rosenergoatom nuclear power engineering company, told TASS on Thursday. \"The rotation of the IAEA inspectors will take place today. Three of them [members of the IAEA’s onsite delegation - TASS] are departing and two will arrive - an Australian [national] and a Slovak [national],\" he said. According to Karchaa, both groups of IAEA monitors would be escorted by a representative of the UN Department of Security and Safety. He also said that three monitors have already set off in the direction of Vasilyevka, where the rotation was set to take place. In early September 2022, the IAEA’s fact-finding mission, led by the agency’s director general, Rafael Grossi, visited the plant. After the mission’s departure, two staff members of the agency remained at the plant in the status of observers. It was agreed at that time that several IAEA monitors would stay at the facility and would be replaced with a new group every month or so. All the rotations were carried out in due time, except for the one in February, which was disrupted a few times because of the UN Department of Safety and Security. As a result, the IAEA’s fifth mission had stayed at the plant for almost two months until they were replaced by a new group on March 2. The Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, located in the city of Energodar, has a capacity of about 6 GW and is Europe’s largest. It has been controlled by Russian troops since late February 2022. Since then, Ukrainian army units have periodically shelled both residential areas in Energodar and the premises of the NPP itself, using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. An IAEA mission led by Director General Rafael Grossi traveled to the ZNPP in September 2022 and left several agency employees onsite as observers. Afterward, the agency published a report calling for the establishment of a safety zone around the ZNPP to prevent accidents arising from hostilities. The expert team at the ZNPP underwent its first rotation in October. Grossi said on March 9 that the ZNPP had had its power supply fully cut off for the first time since November, and that it had enough diesel fuel for electric generators to last 15 days. He said eight out of 20 available generators were working to provide electricity to the plant, while others remain on standby.",

        "text": "ST. PETERSBURG, April 27. /TASS/. The Admiralty Shipyard (part of the United Shipbuilding Corporation) floated out the Project 636.3 fifth diesel-electric submarine Mozhaisk built for the Russian Pacific Fleet, a TASS correspondent reported from the scene on Thursday. The launch ceremony was attended by Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov, Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Viktor Yevtukhov, Chairman of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Board of Directors Georgy Poltavchenko, Admiralty Shipyard CEO Andrey Veselov and CEO of the Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Engineering Igor Vilnit. The Mozhaisk is the fifth submarine in a series of Project 636.3 diesel-electric subs built for the Pacific Fleet. Project 636.3 diesel-electric subs have been developed by the Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Engineering. A contract for the construction of six submarines for the Russian Pacific Fleet was signed in September 2016. The Admiralty Shipyard in Russia’s northwest has already delivered the Project 636.3 diesel-electric submarines Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Volkhov, Magadan and Ufa to the Pacific Fleet. In 2021, the shipbuilders laid down the Project’s sixth submarine Yakutsk together with the Mozhaisk. The submarine Yakutsk is set to the delivered to the Navy in 2024. Project 636.3 Varshavyanka-class submarines (NATO reporting name: Improved Kilo-II) belong to the third generation of large diesel-electric underwater cruisers. They are 74 meters long and displace more than 3,900 tons. Due to their strong hull, the submarines have an operational depth of 240 meters and can dive to a maximum depth of 300 meters. The submarines of this Project have an operational range of up to 7,500 miles. They are armed with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles that are launched from torpedo tubes from the sub’s submerged position. Project 636 submarines are considered among the world’s quietest underwater cruisers. They can develop a speed of up to 20 knots, have their sea endurance of 45 days and a crew of 52. The Russian Pacific Fleet is set to receive all the Project 636.3 submarines with Kalibr cruise missiles on their board by 2024.",

Russia’s embassy to Khartoum does not possess any information about the seizure of a bio laboratory in Sudan, Russian Ambassador to Sudan Andrey Chernovol told TASS on Wednesday. \"So far, no such information has been released here, but for this statement,\" the diplomat said, commenting on the statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) . On Tuesday, the WHO expressed concern over the seizure of a biological laboratory in Sudan by one of the parties to the conflict that has gripped the country. The WHO said that \"when the electricity shut down and with no technician taking care of all these, the risk of biological hazard is high in Khartoum because of the occupation of the lab by one of the fighting parties.\" The WHO representative added that \"there is high risk of biological hazards because in that lab we have already isolates, we have measles isolates as well as cholera isolates.\" The situation in Sudan escalated amid disagreements between the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who also heads the ruling Sovereignty Council, and the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), who is al-Burhan’s deputy on the council. The main points of contention between the two military organizations pertain to the timeline and methods for unifying the armed forces of Sudan, as well as who should be appointed as commander-in-chief of the army: a career military officer, which is al-Burhan’s preferred option, or an elected civilian president, as Dagalo insists. On April 15, armed clashes between the rival military factions erupted near a military base in Merowe and in the capital, Khartoum. According to the country’s health ministry, more than 600 people have been killed in the country since the conflict broke out. In turn, the World Health Organization reported that the conflict had claimed about 450 lives with over 4,000 people suffering injuries.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 26. /TASS/. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday warned Great Britain and those who could employ depleted uranium shells about their responsibility for the deliveries and use of this ammunition. \"The Britons must be aware that they will have to bear responsibility for this [the deliveries of depleted uranium shells to Ukraine]. And, of course, those who will directly use these munitions must be aware that they will not only inflict irreparable damage on themselves and their citizens but will also be held responsible for that,\" the Russian presidential spokesman said. \"We have already drawn the attention of the Western public to the official data published after the use of this type of ammunition during the bombings of Yugoslavia and the data on the incidence of oncological and other diseases that increased significantly,\" Peskov said. As the Kremlin press secretary said, \"this information is very deplorable.\" British Minister of State for the Armed Forces James Heappey confirmed in a written response to a question from Scottish Alba Party MP Kenny MacAskill that Great Britain had sent Ukraine thousands of shells for Challenger 2 tanks, including depleted uranium munitions. According to Heappey, London is not tracking their use and has no obligation to eliminate the consequences of their use after the conflict’s completion. On March 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the plans for supplying depleted uranium munitions indicated the West's determination to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. Putin noted that Russia would have to respond to such moves. He added that the country had hundreds of thousands of such munitions but had not used any of them yet.",

The crew of the diesel-electric submarine Ufa carrying Kalibr cruise missiles practiced deep dives during the Baltic Fleet’s drills in a combat training area, the Fleet’s press office reported on Wednesday. \"As part of the drills, the submarine crew accomplished the assigned objectives of submerging to various depths,\" the press office said in a statement. During the sub’s submergence, its crew inspected the operation of all of its systems and mechanisms, practiced the algorithms of vessel control at various depths and various methods of surfacing, the press office said. \"After the submerged part of the exercise was over, the Ufa crew continued its operations in its surfaced position in accordance with the Fleet’s combat training plan,\" it specified. Small anti-submarine warfare ships, rescue and tug vessels of the Baltiysk naval base provided support for the submarine’s drills, the press office reported.

The training of the Belarusian missile personnel in Russia focused on \"further developing the practical skills of preparing the missile system for its employment, the training in its deployment, and carrying combat training launches,\" the statement reads. \"The personnel of the teams studied in detail the issues of maintaining and employing tactical special munitions for the Iskander-M tactical missile system,\" the ministry added. The Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on April 22 the return of Iskander-M teams to the republic from Russia after their combat training. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier announced that at the request of the Belarusian side, Russia would store its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, pointing out that the United States had long been using this practice on the territory of its allies. Putin added that the Russian side was assisting the Belarusian personnel in re-equipping their combat aircraft and had also handed over Iskander nuclear-capable tactical missile systems to the republic. The Iskander-M theater missile system is designed to strike adversary low-sized and site targets from a range of up to 500 km: missile launchers, multiple launch rocket systems, long-range artillery, aircraft and helicopters at aerodromes, command posts and communications centers.",

The Kiev government’s forces are sustaining heavy losses in Artyomovsk (Ukrainian name Bakhmut), because the country’s top brass did not prepare the city for defense, according to a Ukrainian general. \"We are paying a terrible price for this city. The thing is that certain [commanding officers] have made mistakes and did not prepare the city for proper defense,\" said the former deputy commander of Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces, ex-deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, General Sergey Krivonos. \"Not just approaches to Bakhmut should have been prepared, the city itself should have been readied for defense. This was not done properly, and now these issues are resulting in quite heavy losses,\" he said in an interview to Channel Five . In his opinion, Ukrainian troops should have left Artyomovsk back in February. He also noted that the Kiev government was experiencing huge problems in the training of mobilized soldiers. Artyomovsk is located on the Kiev-controlled part of the Donetsk People’s Republic and is a major transportation hub for the Ukrainian army’s supplies in Donbass. Fierce fighting for the city is underway. As adviser to the acting DPR head Yan Gagin told TASS on April 18, Russian forces control already almost 90% of Artyomovsk. Acting head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Denis Pushilin said on April 24 that . Russian forces had advanced in the northwestern and western parts of Artyomovsk, but the situation remains tense there.",

Russia would like to keep the personnel currently working at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant as intact as possible, Renat Karchaa, an adviser to Rosenergoatom’s CEO, said in an interview with TASS. As of today, more than 3,000 employees are under contract with the company that operates the plant, he added. Earlier, Karchaa told TASS that by the end of April, the plant’s staff will expand by another 1,200 people. \"Hiring new employees is possible. Our talent pool is significant and diverse in all areas of expertise. But our main course remains unchanged - to preserve as much as possible the team that was formed at the plant before it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. This is not rhetoric, this is part of our corporate ideology. We proclaimed it and we will consistently follow it, no matter how hard it is,\" he stressed. According to the Rosenergoatom official, under Russian standards, about 5,000-6,000 people are needed to operate the plant. \"As for the number of plant personnel under Russian standards, the Zaporozhye NPP needs 5,000-6,000 employees, taking into account the work of all six units,\" he said. The Zaporozhye NPP, located in Energodar, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The total capacity of its six reactors is about 6,000 megawatts. In late February 2022, the facility was taken under control by Russian forces. Since then, the Ukrainian military has been periodically bombarding both Energodar’s residential neighborhoods and the premises of the Zaporozhye nuclear plant, using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. Most of the attacks have been repelled by air defenses, but on several occasions shells have been recorded hitting the plant’s infrastructure and the dry cask storage area. Engineering structures are being erected at the Zaporozhye NPP to shield the facility, acting much like \"airbags.\" Two energy units of the Zaporozhye NPP have been put into \"hot shutdown,\" or low-power operation, thus supplying heat to Energodar. Two more units have entered a so-called state of \"cold shutdown,\" while the remaining two units are undergoing repairs. The only power line that transmits electricity to the plant from Ukraine is in operation.",

        "text": "ANKARA, April 25. /TASS/. The defense ministers and intelligence chiefs of Turkey, Russia, Syria and Iran stressed the importance of the quadrilateral platform for ensuring stability in Syria and the region in general, the Turkish Defense Ministry said after Tuesday's talks in Moscow, noting that they were constructive. \"At the end of the meeting, which was held in a constructive atmosphere, the importance of stability in Syria and the region and the importance of more meetings on the four-nation platform to ensuring it was stressed,\" the statement reads. The meeting in Moscow discussed ways of strengthening security in Syria, concrete steps to normalize relations between Turkey and Syria, counter terrorist organizations and extremist groups on Syrian territory, and step up efforts to facilitate the repatriation of Syrian refugees. \"The sides reaffirmed respect for Syria's territorial integrity,\" the Turkish Defense Ministry said. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and Turkish National Intelligence Organization head Hakan Fidan took part in the talks in Moscow on Ankara’s behalf. Normalization of relations between Ankara and Damascus started in Moscow on December 28, 2022, when the defense ministers of Russia, Syria and Turkey met for consultations. At the meeting, an agreement was reached to establish a joint trilateral commission. These consultations are to be followed by a meeting at the level of foreign ministers, with talks between Turkish and Syrian presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad on the agenda. It was later reported that Iran would participate in the consultations at the foreign minister level. The four-nation foreign minister level meeting is expected to be held in Moscow in early May. Erdogan told the media on December 15 last year that he had addressed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin with a proposal for holding a trilateral meeting with the Syrian leader. This summit, he said, should be preceded by talks at the level of special services and defense and foreign ministers.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. Russia is looking at a number of creative alternatives to get electricity to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, Renat Karchaa, an adviser to Rosenergoatom’s CEO, said in an interview with TASS. Currently, the Zaporozhye NPP depends on electricity from Ukraine, which goes through one Dnieper transmission line and the Kiev regime uses this as a tool for blackmail, he added. \"Ukraine's policy on this matter is nuclear blackmail in its purest form. The powers that be in Ukraine use the power line as a tool (of blackmail - TASS). But we do not sit around and wait for them to come up with another way to blackmail us. Of course, we are hedging, we’re coming up with different options, we’re just doing it quietly.\" Karchaa noted that all these ideas are at different stages in the creative process. \"But it is pointless to intimidate and starve Russia into surrender, including through such blackmail. All solutions are in the interests of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the norms and standards of nuclear safety, for the benefit of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the people living and working on this territory, and for the sake of their peaceful development, sooner or later they will be found. I am sure of this,\" Karchaa stressed. On March 22, the observers of the International Atomic Energy Agency received information that the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant may have its last 750 kv backup power line disconnected for \"maintenance and repair.\" However, the agency noted that they do not have any information about \"whether this will happen, when and how long it will last.\" Karchaa told TASS that Ukraine would deal another blow to the nuclear safety of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant if it decided to cut off the last backup power line. He clarified that if the Kiev authorities take this step, the plant will have to switch to diesel generators.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. After the second visit of IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency) Director General Rafael Grossi to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, it has become easier for Russia and the IAEA chief to conduct a dialogue on the plant’s safety, Renat Karchaa, an adviser to Rosenergoatom’s CEO, said in an interview with TASS. In particular, this happened thanks to the permanent presence of the agency’s inspectors at the plant, he added. \"If during his first visit he (Grossi - TASS) was on a fact-finding mission and did not fully understand a lot of things, now he is deep into the subject, in particular thanks to the inspectors who stayed at the Zaporozhye NPP on a permanent basis,\" Karchaa said. The Rosenergoatom official noted that in this matter Grossi is \"walking a tightrope, a fine line between what is achievable and what is possible.\" \"He is for nuclear safety. That is for sure. In my opinion, he is sincere when he agrees with us that a nuclear plant should never be fired upon with anything and under any pretext. In this sense, he is with us,\" the expert added. Karchaa stressed that the main result of Grossi's second visit to the Zaporozhye NPP was the assertion that attacks on the plant were unacceptable and that the idea of demilitarizing its territory was abandoned. \"Until recently, Grossi linked the security of the Zaporozhye NPP with the so-called demilitarization of both the plant and adjacent territories, but he was mistaken. This delusion was largely imposed on him by the Ukrainian regime and the United States, the UK and a number of other states representing the most aggressive wing of the collective West that are most supportive to it (the Ukrainian regime - TASS). These are the forces that, under the cover of the Zaporozhye NPP factor, unscrupulously manipulating nuclear safety, sought to solve a number of military-tactical tasks,\" the expert explained. Grossi has visited the Zaporozhye NPP twice over the past year. His first visit took place on September 1, 2022 and resulted in establishing a permanent presence of IAEA inspectors at the ZNPP. On March 29, 2023, Grossi visited the plant for the second time and inspected its territory. He was shown objects that were damaged as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces. In particular, he saw the impact of a missile that fell between coolant tanks at the fourth power unit. Grossi then announced the need for additional measures to protect the NPP.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. Russia may be the first to use nuclear weapons if aggression against it threatens the very existence of the state, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday, addressing participants in the Znanie (Knowledge) educational marathon. Medvedev was speaking by video link from the defense sector enterprise NPO Mashinostroyenia, which is one of the leading players in Russia's rocket and space industry. Military hardware features prominently on the list of its products. \"You’ve said that Russia would never use nuclear weapons first, but that's not quite so,\" Medvedev said in commenting on a remark by one of the participants. He quoted paragraph 19 of Russia's nuclear doctrine. \"It explicitly states that nuclear weapons can be used when aggression is carried out against Russia with the use of other types of weapons that endanger the very existence of the state. It is essentially the use of nuclear weapons in response to such actions. Our potential adversaries should not underestimate this,\" he stressed. In his opinion, speculation to the effect that Russia would never use nuclear weapons or is merely scaring everyone with nuclear weapons is not worthy of attention. \"Western analysts and Western commanders, both military and political leaders, should simply assess our rules and our intentions,\" Medvedev stressed. In general, he went on to say, nuclear weapons are of paramount importance for the existence of Russia as a major country in the world. \"There may be different attitudes to nuclear weapons, and to weapons in general, but nevertheless we understand that in today's world nuclear weapons for our country have the significance of a bond that keeps the state together,\" he pointed out. Medvedev spoke separately about the readiness to use such weapons. \"I can tell you as someone who is in the know. I can tell you frankly: If you have a weapon in your hands - and as a former president, I know what it is like - you must be ready to use it in a given situation, no matter how awful and brutal this may sound. All these factors should not be underestimated by our potential adversaries, the countries that we now quite appropriately call enemies,\" he said. Under its nuclear doctrine, Russia may use nuclear arms if the enemy uses these or other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies; if there is reliable information about the launch of a ballistic missile attack on Russia and its allies; and if the enemy attacks facilities crucial to retaliatory actions by its nuclear forces; as well as in cases of aggression against Russia with conventional weapons that endanger the very existence of the state.",

The interaction in the area of missile defense between the US and other Western countries poses significant problems due to the fact that the national capabilities of Washington's allies are increasingly integrated with elements of the US’ unregulated national missile defense system,\" the diplomat explained.",

Russia is considering various options of evacuating its citizens from Sudan but the decision has not yet been made, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday. \"Our people on site are monitoring the situation very carefully, are constantly in touch with Moscow, round-the-clock consultations and interaction are underway on a regular basis,\" the Kremlin official said. According to him, \"very diverse options\" are being considered. However, \"the decision has not yet been made,\" Peskov concluded. On Monday, Russian Ambassador to Sudan Andrey Chernovol told TASS that the Russian side was working on the issue of evacuating Russians from Sudan weighing all risks. He explained that the delay was related to the assessment of certain risks and threats which had to be minimized. The situation in Sudan escalated amid disagreements between the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who also heads the ruling Sovereignty Council, and the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), who is al-Burhan’s deputy on the council. On April 15, clashes erupted near a military base in Merowe and in the capital, Khartoum. The latest data by the World Health Organization indicates that more than 420 civilians have been killed in the clashes and over 3,700 people have been injured. The clashes continued on Tuesday despite an earlier ceasefire. Thousands of foreign nationals have been evacuated from Sudan over recent days. Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France have shut down their embassies in Khartoum while many other countries are reducing their diplomatic presence or transferring their missions to neighboring countries.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. Moscow is keeping the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the loop on all additional measures that are being taken to ensure the security of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Renat Karchaa, an advisor to the chief executive of Russia’s Rosenergoatom nuclear power plant operator, said in an interview with TASS. \"The IAEA is aware of all design solutions to strengthen the protection of the ZNPP. Inspectors on site at the plant are actively working in accordance with their mandate. It’s impossible to hide anything from them. Anyway, we have never sought to do anything like that. We are transparent and open to a constructive dialogue,\" he pointed out. Karchaa noted that the IAEA inspectors \"have all information about the situation at the plant.\" \"They are engaged in monitoring activities. Two meetings are held every day where we discuss the current situation and the prospects for the next day, and they ask questions,\" he added, noting that access to any facility on the premises may be provided to the inspectors upon request. When asked about the level of confidence in the IAEA inspectors, the expert said that \"these days, you can’t fully trust anyone.\" However, he stressed that no espionage attempts by the IAEA employees had been recorded so far. The IAEA’s permanent mission to the Zaporozhye NPP was established following IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi’s first trip to the facility in early September 2022. The parties agreed that several IAEA experts would maintain a continuous presence at the plant and their teams would rotate about once a month. Since then, six staff rotations have taken place. All rotations were held on time, with the exception of the last one, which had to be postponed several times due to the fault of the UN Department for Safety and Security. As a result, the fifth IAEA mission remained at the plant for almost two months until they were replaced by a new group of inspectors.",

Russia could take certain asymmetric steps if the United States and NATO pursue escalation in the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe, Vladimir Yermakov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Department, said in an interview with TASS. \"If the United States and NATO decide to escalate things further, we will assess the new risks to identify an [appropriate] response, including an asymmetric one,\" the diplomat said, when asked whether the West could deploy its nukes close to Belarus’ borders in the wake of Russia’s decision to station part of its nuclear arsenal on Belarusian soil. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that, at Minsk’s request, Russia would station its tactical nuclear weapons in the neighboring country, precisely the way the United States has long kept its own nuclear warheads on the territories of its allies. According to Putin, Moscow has already transferred the nuclear-capable Iskander system to Minsk and is helping its Belarusian counterparts to refurbish their aircraft. Earlier this month, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov rebuked the West for its hysteria over Russia’s plans to install storage facilities for such weapons in Belarus, while preferring to forget about the presence of US nukes in Europe.",

        "text": "MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. The line of contact should be pushed back at least 300 kilometers away from the city of Energodar to ensure the safety of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Renat Karchaa, an advisor to the chief executive of Russia’s Rosenergoatom nuclear power plant operator, said in an interview with TASS. \"We largely believe that stability at and the development of the ZNPP depends on changes along the line of contact. Once it is pushed far enough away, by at least 300 kilometers, it will be possible to speak far more confidently about the real prospects for development and the absence of threats,\" Karchaa noted. According to him, a disaster at the plant is out of the question at the moment, \"of course, as long as people at the Pentagon don’t send more advanced and longer-ranged weapons [to Kiev] and their mentally unstable wards in Ukraine don’t use those to attack the plant.\" Karchaa added that in case of a disaster, radioactive contamination would not impact the US but \"would cover a large part of Europe.\" Karchaa emphasized that the unstable security situation at the Zaporozhye NPP was affecting the facility’s development. He specified that two power units were undergoing repairs although \"work has to be carried out in a much more cautious manner, with a focus on the safety of people, which certainly is significantly slowing the pace of repairs.\" \"Ukraine can send a reconnaissance drone followed by combat drones, or conduct an artillery shelling of the plant at any moment,\" the expert explained. Karchaa also stated that the power plant would definitely start to operate and produce energy in the near future. The six-reactor, six-gigawatt Zaporozhye NPP, located in Energodar, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russian forces took control of the facility in late February 2022. Since then, the Ukrainian army has been shelling both the residential areas of Energodar and the power plant’s premises using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems.",

It is good that we added funds under state financing in recent years and, importantly, our defense industry has preserved its scientific, personnel and production potential and that the attempts were crushed to squander it, sell it off or give up something,\" he explained. Today, the Russian defense industry can \"cope with any tasks,\" Medvedev stressed. \"This also relates to precision weapons and tube artillery, tanks and a lot of other needed weapons, military and special hardware,\" the senior security official said and thanked all the defense industry’s workers.",

Earlier, the founder of Private Military Company (PMC) Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that Peskov's son had served in Wagner’s artillery as a loader on a transport and loading vehicle for the Uragan multiple launch rocket system (MLRS). \"First, he had served in the [Russian] Armed Forces. He fulfilled his constitutional duty. Now he has made this decision. He is an adult. It is true that he took part in the special military operation. I would prefer not to say anything else. It has nothing to do with my job,\" Peskov said in response to questions about whether his son had actually served in a PMC and why he had chosen not to re-enlist in the Armed Forces. Prigozhin said that Nikolay Peskov had spent about six months in the special military operation zone and had displayed courage and heroism.",

        "text": "SEOUL, April 24. /TASS/. Russia views the very admission by South Korea that it could potentially supply weapons to Kiev as an extension of Seoul’s unfriendly policy regarding the situation surrounding Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to Seoul Andrey Kulik said in an interview with the Mindle News outlet. \"Since the start of the special operation in Ukraine, South Korea has been maintaining a rather unfriendly position. [Russia] believes that the fact that the issue of potential [weapons] supplies was raised at all is a reflection of this unfriendly stance,\" the media outlet quoted the envoy as saying. The diplomat pointed out that Russia’s armed forces targeted only military facilities. \"South Korea and Western countries keep ignoring mass civilian killings, which have been going on in the Donbass since 2014,\" the ambassador said. South Korea \"understands well\" what consequences any move on its part to join those countries now providing military assistance to Ukraine would have for bilateral relations, Kulik went on to say. He also reiterated that Moscow might have to reconsider cooperating with Seoul on issues facing the Korean Peninsula. When assessing the situation in the region following the coming to power of a new government in South Korea, the ambassador said that military and political tensions were continuing to escalate. \"The situation is the result of the United States’ refusal to resolve issues related to the Korean Peninsula through diplomatic and political means,\" the diplomat stated. He slammed sanctions and pressure as a dead-end path and called on the parties to resume the implementation of the agreements reached in Singapore in 2018. The Russian diplomat admitted that foreign companies, including South Korean ones, were dealing with problems in trade with Russia but those problems stemmed from the sanctions imposed by Western countries and not from any steps taken by the Russian government. \"We welcome the position of those South Korean corporations that stood their ground, unlike Western companies that abruptly left the Russian market after the launch of the special military operation,\" Kulik said. Meanwhile, the envoy stated that Russia had not taken any retaliatory measures with respect to the South Korean president’s remark about the possibility of weapons supplies. \"No retaliatory measures have been taken because no weapons supplies have taken place yet,\" the media outlet quoted the ambassador as saying. \"The Russian authorities do not take any hostile retaliatory measures toward companies. Russia only takes measures to reduce the damage from Western sanctions. Such measures can impact companies,\" the envoy said. He stressed that Russia maintained an open position and was ready for dialogue to mitigate the problems that South Korean companies were facing.",

Irretrievable losses by Ukraine’s armed forces in the zone of Russia’s special military operation have surpassed 4,000 over the past week, but the Kiev regime officially recognized only 10% of this figure, LPR People's Militia retired Lieutenant Colonel Andrey Marochko told TASS on Monday. \"Over the past week, the irretrievable losses of Ukrainian militants along the entire line of combat engagement have amounted to over 4,000 people, with only 10% of them being officially recognized while the rest are listed as missing in action,\" he said, citing Russian intelligence. The military expert noted that the relatives of killed Ukrainian servicemen in order to receive objective information about them have to turn to ombudsmen from the LPR and DPR despite the threat of penal sanctions.",

US servicemen will remain in Djibouti to ensure the safety of US civil servants over the situation in Sudan and additional forces are ready to be deployed if necessary, according to a written notice by US President Joe Biden on using the armed forces to evacuate diplomats from the country. \"At my direction, United States Armed Forces personnel have conducted an operation to evacuate United States personnel and others from Khartoum, Sudan, in response to the deteriorating security situation in Sudan. To conduct and support this operation, United States Armed Forces personnel with appropriate combat equipment deployed to Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Sudan. United States Armed Forces personnel will remain deployed in Djibouti to protect United States personnel and others until the security situation no longer requires their presence, and additional forces are prepared to deploy to the region if required,\" the US leader stressed in his letter published on Sunday and addressed to the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate. The situation in Sudan escalated amid disagreements between the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who also heads the ruling Sovereign Council, and the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), who is al-Burhan’s deputy on the council. On April 15, clashes erupted near a military base in Merowe and in the capital, Khartoum. According to the Health Ministry, over 600 people have been killed in the country since the hostilities began. The latest data by the World Health Organization indicates that more than 420 civilians have been killed in the clashes and over 3,700 people have been injured.",

Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that the decision to establish a checkpoint on the Lachin corridor was legitimate and slammed Armenia’s statement on this matter as an attempt to meddle in its domestic affairs. \"The Armenian foreign ministry’s statement is yet another attempt to interfere into Azerbaijan’s domestic affairs and its is unacceptable. <…> The Azerbaijani’s side’s legitimate decision to establish a border checkpoint in its territory is in conformity with all principles and norms of international law,\" it said in a statement. The ministry said that Yerevan’s accusations that Baku has violated its commitments under the trilateral statement are ungrounded. \"Under the trilateral statement, Azerbaijan undertook to guarantee safe movement of people, vehicles and cargoes along the road linking Lachin and Khankendi (known as Stepanakert in Armenia). This commitment includes measures to prevent abuses of the Lachin road. Apart from that, the establishment of a checkpoint at the beginning of the road introduces no changes into the traffic regime,\" it stressed. Baku also lambasted Yerevan’s statements that the establishment of the checkpoint is geared to launch \"ethnic purges\" as groundless and absurd. \"We state once again that there are all the conditions for transparent, safe and orderly movement of Armenian residents of Azerbaijan’s Karabakh region via this checkpoint in both directions,\" the ministry stressed. According to the ministry, the statement by the foreign ministry of Armenia, \"which boycotted peace talks, indicates its intentions to use this as a pretext to undermine efforts toward the resumption of talks.\" \"We recommend the Armenian side drop such provocations, demonstrate a responsible approach to the efforts toward building its relations with Azerbaijan on the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, instead of using various pretext to hamper peace talks,\" it stressed.",

Rebellions have begun among Ukrainian servicemen in Chasov Yar and Konstantinovka, as they are dropping their arms and walking out, Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the PMC Wagner, said on Saturday. \"Revolts have begun among the servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces in Chasov Yar and Konstantinovka. They are dropping their arms, rising and leaving,\" said Prigozhin, cited on his press service’s Telegram channel. This is how Prigozhin responded to a request to comment on reports that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky had demanded from Ground Forces Commander Alexander Syrsky that his troops stand their ground in Artyomovsk (known as Bakhmut in Ukraine) until May 9, so as \"to prevent a big informational victory of Russia.\" Artyomovsk, located in the Kiev-controlled area of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), is a major transport hub supplying the Ukrainian military grouping in Donbass. Yan Gagin, an advisor to DPR head, told TASS on April 18 that Russia’s forces had taken control of nearly 90% of Artyomovsk.",
